# Immersive-Simulator-Project
This is an old unity3D project focused on breaking different systems, such as dialogue, interactions, creatures, etc. Into small modules that can be used with each other to so that one may trigger damage on any creature or object through, for example, a dialogue option or an interaction with a certain object.
